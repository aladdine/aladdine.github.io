<h1>Welcome to Aladdine's demo page</h1>
<h3>Symmary:</h3>
<p>I love solving complex clean energy problems by building robust software solutions. In this webpage, I demo some of the apps I built along with the source code in Github.</p>
<h3>Roofly:</h3>
<p>This web app uses the Google Maps API and PV Watts to estimate the surface area of a roof (or land) and how much solar radiation it receives in the course of a full year. This data is then used to price the roof (or land) so the home owner can lease the it to solar installers to put solar panels on it.</p>
